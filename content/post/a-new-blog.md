# Out of Gas

I am starting this blog thing again, because I believe I can use this as a productive outlet and share my tech journey. To be honest my journey in tech has been rather borring, I have lost the passion I once felt.

I almost feel like my career life is on empty, though I do my best to maintain my tech prowess and I am employed in a well paying job. It is becoming monotonous to stay on the cutting edge.

I often wonder, if it is just me?

Do others have a constantly burned out feeling? That no matter how much they resolve to not work. They get stuck with new work. And how much they say the will start something for themselves (a business, a idea that is not for profit, a hobby) it is still on the drawing board. And that the accumulation of all attempts is never on par with the completion of attempts or the successes of those that were not completly baked.

Maybe, the fault lies in that we try to compare ourselves to our heroe's. Whether they be pillars of their local technical community or maybe they are the elusive legend of tech like the Job's and Wozniacks of the world.
